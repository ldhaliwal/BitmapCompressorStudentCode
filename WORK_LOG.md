Thought about what data points needed to be represented in the compressed file in order for expansion to be possible. Came up with an idea to write floats into the compressed file the, the main part being the count of whatever digit is being compressed, and the decimal as either a .0 or .1 to indicate which bit to write out. not sure how much this will compress, because I think each float is 32 bits, and that could add up if we have a lot of short sequences of 1s or 0s. |

| November 20 |  7:30-9pm   | Started with my code compressing down to well under 30% (for the 32x48 file at least) but not being able to expand. Honestly not sure whats going wrong, everything looks right to me, and logically I think it should be working, but it doesn't I've tried a bunch of iterations for the expand method, and nothing is working. if I write our my count to the compressed file in 8 bits, and read it back in the expand method in 8 bits, it throws and empty input error, but if I set both to 7 bits, it doesn't give me an error, but also still doesn't work. at this point I think the computer science gods hate me. I'm sure there's some silly mistake i'm missing, or a better way to represent some of the data (do I need a header?!?) but I've spent a lot of time on this tonight and have to get to other work. |
